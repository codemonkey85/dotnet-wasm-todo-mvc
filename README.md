## How to debug with chrome dev tools

- Start the app with debugging enabled:
    ```
    dotnet run --debug
    ```
- In another console start the chrome with remote debugging enabled:
    ```
    chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 http://127.0.0.1:9000/index.html
    ```
- Open the `chrome:\inspect` tab
- Click on configure button
- Copy the address printed on first console in this case `127.0.0.1:53485`
    ```
    Debug proxy for chrome now listening on http://127.0.0.1:53485/. 
    ```
- Paste the value like `127.0.0.1:53485` to the chome's `Target discovery settings`
- From the `Remote target ` Choose line `.NET 7 â€¢ TodoMVC http://127.0.0.1:9000/index.html` and click `inspect`
- In another browser tab you should see chrome dev tools
- Swith to `Sources` tab
- In the files tree expand `file://` and find `Store.cs`
- Add breakpoint into `void Insert` method
- In the running app browser tab add new todo item, the breakpoint should be hit

*All of above would be much simpler as just "F5" in Visual Studio when we release final .NET 7*
